## Summary

The data shows that the bike sharing service in New York city was high during the month of August 2019. A peak number of riders rented a bike for 5 to 6 hours and the far majority of the rides were taken by male users during morning and evening rush hours. This implies that Citi Bike services are used as an alternative to public transportation by commuting workers.
Two Additional analysis that would be beneficial are :

- Comparing data for different months to determine trends across the year.
- Average distance between customers home location and the bike renting location.
